# Fable.Form.Simple.MaterialUI
A simple MaterialUI implementation for Fable.Form

Using the excellent for of [Fable.Form](https://github.com/MangelMaxime/Fable.Form) I have added this 'Simple form' implementation based on the work by [Feliz.MaterialUI](https://github.com/Shmew/Feliz.MaterialUI).

**Remember**: Install the npm package references:

```
npm install @material-ui/core
npm install @material-ui/lab
npm install @material-ui/icons
```

__DISCLAIMER__: I have created this simple opinionated implementation for MaterialUI for my own use, some of the implementations of the MaterialUI elements might not match 100% with all requirements, but they work for me. Let me know where I have erred and I we will fix it.
